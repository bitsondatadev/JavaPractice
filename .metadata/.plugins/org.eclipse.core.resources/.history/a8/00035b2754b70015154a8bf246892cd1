 * BinarySearch algorithms that require that type T implements comparable.
 * 
 * I want to make a few remarks on the "? super T" syntax. It's called a wild card and is used in conjunction with "super".
 * Super in Generics is the opposite of extends. Instead of saying the comparable's generic type has to be a subclass of T, 
 * it is saying it has to be a superclass of T.
 * A List<? super Integer>, for example, includes List<Integer>, List<Number>, and List<Object>.
