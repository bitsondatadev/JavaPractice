/**
 * BinarySearch algorithms that require that type T implements comparable.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(log(n))
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 * 
 * Assumptions: Input array is a distinct sorted list.
 * 
 * I want to make a few remarks on the "? super T" syntax. It's called a wild card and is used in conjunction with "super".
 * Super in Generics is the opposite of extends. Instead of saying the comparable's generic type has to be a subclass of T, 
 * it is saying it has to be a superclass of T.
 * A List<? super Integer>, for example, includes List<Integer>, List<Number>, and List<Object>.
 * 
 * Another interesting thing I learned was about how to use Generics with static methods. Notice the <T> I place after
 * each method. What this does is allows me to specify the type at runtime and the static method (having already been
 * created) will assume that I am being honest and T will indeed extend Comparable<? super>. Otherwise i'm in crash city.
 * This is why we have to two cast warnings below when I call the compareTo method. Now I don't have to create instance
 * objects every time I want to call binary search. :)
